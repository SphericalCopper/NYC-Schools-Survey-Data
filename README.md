# NYC Schools Survey Data

Data taken from surveys was used to investigate as to whether the perceptions of a schools by 1) Students, 2) Teachers, and 3) Parents appeared correlated to the academic success of students from that school (the metric for academic success being SAT scores). 

We also investigated how these 3 groups of surveyed people differed in their perceptions. Relationships between SAT scores and a school's various demographic factors were also explored.
